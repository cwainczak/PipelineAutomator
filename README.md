- Used RegEx to parse through HTML files to process future automation work as well as detect duplicate and missing entries.
- Stored current work progress and future work to .txt files through write operations, yielding better efficiency and execution flow during runtime.
- Utilized the PyAutoGui library for image detection and I/O device operations.
