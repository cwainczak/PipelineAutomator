A personal Python Automation app for better work flow and efficiency.

- Provides automation for previous work on a database of videos.
- Used RegEx to parse through HTML files to process future automation work as well as detect duplicate and missing entries.
- Saved work progress and future work through write operations (improve this one).
- Utilized the PyAutoGui library for image detection and I/O device operations.
